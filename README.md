### ALGORITHMS 1 Checkpoint

## What You're Aiming For
An algorithm that reads a sentence, which ends with a period, character by character, and determines the following:
1. The length of the sentence (the number of characters).
2. The number of words in the sentence (assuming that the words are separated by a single space).
3. The number of vowels in the sentence.

## Instructions
- Each character will be treated separately.
- The last character is the period.
- Use three variables as counters.
